I felt Impostor Syndrome, when I was building my first project. I had to deal with everything, starting from design, coding, hosting, database design, publishing.
And I have never done this before. My previous incomplete task in different fields trying to supress my work. I was feeling that I am not that tallanted guy who can do all these things.

The positive thoughts and my previous success in various fields, empowered me to step into it.

On my way I faced so many hurdles in all most every new step/concept.
Twist : After approximately 2 months I have completed my project and also placed the app in play store. I was feeling so excited to show my project to friends. Some of my friends installed it in their mobile and I got good feedback also. I keep asking if they find some issue, just let me know. After 2 days one of my friends raised a issue regarding the app.
On that day I felt like doing nothing, so harass.
What to do next, how to approach, whom to ask, what is the error, why the error… came into mind.
I decided to solve it. I found what was wrong also. But the important thing was I had to work on complete different approach: Means again “starting from zero”

Finally it took another 20 days and then successfully published.

My advice to overcome this Impostor Syndrome is : Rewind your success: how you did that ! Than why not this ! I Can.

You will definitely overcome.
